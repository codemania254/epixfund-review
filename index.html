    </header>

    <article>
        <section>
            <p><strong>EpixFund.com</strong> is a newly launched CFD broker that has begun attracting attention with bold claims and aggressive marketing. In this expert <strong>EpixFund review</strong>, we analyze whether <strong>epixfund.com is legit</strong> or if it is possibly a scam targeting inexperienced traders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Basic Information About EpixFund</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://epixfund.com" target="_blank">epixfund.com</a></li>
                <li><strong>Domain Registration:</strong> April 2025 (very recent)</li>
                <li><strong>Claimed Location:</strong> London, United Kingdom</li>
                <li><strong>Trading Platform:</strong> MT4/MT5 (claimed)</li>
                <li><strong>Account Types:</strong> Bronze ($6,000), Silver ($15,000), Gold ($25,000), Platinum ($50,000), Diamond ($100,000), VIP ($200,000)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Is EpixFund.com Regulated?</h2>
            <p>No. Despite claiming to operate from the UK, <strong>EpixFund.com is not registered or licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</strong>. A search on the official <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/search?q=epixfund.com&type=Companies" target="_blank">FCA register</a> returns no results for this broker.</p>
            <p>They also falsely claim to be operated by Ovex (Pty) Ltd, allegedly licensed by South Africa’s FSCA. We verified this claim through the <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/Fais/Search_FSP.htm" target="_blank">FSCA database</a> and found no such license associated with the entity. This is clear evidence of deception.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Account Types – High Minimum Deposits with No Demo</h2>
            <p>EpixFund offers six types of trading accounts, starting from a shocking minimum deposit of <strong>$6,000</strong> for the Bronze account. This is an extremely high barrier to entry, especially considering the platform does not offer a free demo account. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bronze:</strong> $6,000</li>
                <li><strong>Silver:</strong> $15,000</li>
                <li><strong>Gold:</strong> $25,000</li>
                <li><strong>Platinum:</strong> $50,000</li>
                <li><strong>Diamond:</strong> $100,000</li>
                <li><strong>VIP:</strong> $200,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With no track record and no license, entrusting such high amounts to this broker is highly risky.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>EpixFund as a Prop Trading Firm – A Conflict of Interest?</h2>
            <p>Interestingly, EpixFund markets itself as a prop trading firm as well. Traders must pass a two-step evaluation and, if successful, are promised 60–90% profit splits. This model is typical among <strong>unlicensed “prop firms” offering fake funding</strong>.</p>
            <p>The real concern is conflict of interest: A broker cannot act both as the market maker and the funding body. They control the rules, the demo accounts, and the outcome — all while collecting non-refundable fees from traders who often fail arbitrary challenges. This setup benefits only the firm, not the traders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Marketing Claims and Transparency Issues</h2>
            <p>EpixFund’s website is filled with unverifiable and misleading claims. They mention being featured in financial publications and quote vague success statistics — yet provide <strong>no third-party validation or independent reviews</strong>.</p>
            <p>Additionally, while they promote offering MT4/MT5 platforms and label themselves as an “STP broker,” their structure, lack of regulation, and behavior align more closely with a <strong>market maker model</strong> — profiting when clients lose trades.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Final Verdict – Is EpixFund.com a Scam?</h2>
            <p><strong>EpixFund.com raises multiple red flags that should concern any trader:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No regulatory license (FCA or FSCA)</li>
                <li>Recent domain registration (April 2025)</li>
                <li>Exorbitant minimum deposits</li>
                <li>No demo account or transparency</li>
                <li>Misleading claims about regulation and publicity</li>
                <li>Operating as a supposed prop firm — a serious conflict of interest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Until proven otherwise, we consider EpixFund to be a <strong>high-risk and potentially fraudulent broker</strong>. Traders should avoid depositing funds with this entity.</p>
